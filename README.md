#Health Care System using machine learning

Introduction
Health is Wealth. Latest covid19 pandemic showed the greatest flaws of our health care system i.e., overcrowding and lack of modernization.
To provide each and every individual the basic health facility I came up with the idea to make a health care website hosted on cloud server where anyone will be able quickly check personal health based on symptoms using a model trained on machine learning algorithm. High accuracy and quick results will greatly benefit all users that too at no cost.
Doctors all over the world will be able to help their patients contact them by using this website. Users will also be able to book an appointment with doctors on this platform by creating an account. They will be allowed to edit their profile and appointments. Users will be provided with reviews and feedback facilities too. The website will also serve as a general awareness tool for most of the diseases.


Technologies Used:
Machine Learning Algorithm (Decision Tree) , React, Express, Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas , Pythton, Flask, MongoDB, Javascript.

Steps to run this project:
1. Clone this github repository.
2. Open Disease Prediction Folder.
3. Open Frontend folder in terminal and type "npm install " and after that npm start" to run react frontend.
4. Open ML Model Backend folder in terminal and type "pip install -r requirements.txt" after that "python app.py".
5. Open Appointment Booking folder in terminal and type "node index.js".
